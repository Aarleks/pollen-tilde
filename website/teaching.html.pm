◊topic{Teaching Statement}

Above all else, I approach teaching by trusting students and seeking to be transparent about every aspect of the journey of learning and teaching we will take together.

I value connectedness with learners and creating a sense of belonging for the learning space while aspiring to mastery as a mindset and process. I want my students to be inspired to learn - that is to teach themselves about their subject matter, of course, but also to teach themselves about them as people. I want to help students understand the value of learning not simply as a way of increasing qualification, but as a mechanism of self-understanding and growth. As a teacher, I want my students to leave a class, a course, or a degree eager to learn more and equipped to do so.

My intentions are to help students develop their learning mindset and their abilities to self-learn. In doing this, I want my students to feel they belong together, with me and my teaching colleagues, in the class (whatever 'in the class' might mean). I want my teaching to be a context in which I help set the conditions in which my students can learn.

As an educator, I am trying to help my students develop knowledge, skill, and habits with which to teach themselves and others about the universe.

I can hear one of my old undergrad teachers still.

I want my students to understand for themselves that learning 'what' and learning 'how' are two different but necessary vectors for understanding.
