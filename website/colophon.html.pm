#lang pollen

◊h1{Colophon}

This site is written in ◊link["https://docs.racket-lang.org/pollen/index.html"]{Pollen}, a programming language for publishing web-books. Pollen is an implementation of Racket by the typographer ◊link["https://practicaltypography.com/"]{Matthew Butterick} as a way of being able to call a full programming language from within a document.

Previously, this site was made using ◊link["https://pandoc.org/"]{Pandoc,} which is an excellent document conversion tool. But in ◊in-line{Pollen} I found something more in line with my thinking about documents as programs, that was cleaner than ◊in-line{html} to write in, and had better extensibility than ◊in-line{Markdown.} Plus I was looking for an excuse to tinker on something.

◊li{◊strong{Font:} The body text and most titles are ◊link["https://www.ibm.com/plex/"]{IBM Plex} Mono with IBM Plex Sans Condensed for some page titles.}
◊li{◊strong{CSS:} I originally riffed from the standard pandoc html and borrowed liberally from ◊link["https://tilde.club/~ejw/"]{Edwin Wenink's} tilde.club website. But over time I've also drawn from the Tufte format, Matthew Butterick's typographic advice in ◊link["https://practicaltypography.com/"]{Practical Typography}, and a few other sites that I've now forgotten.}
◊li{◊strong{Code:} Code for this site can be found on my ◊link["https://github.com/Aarleks/pollen-tilde"]{Github.}}
